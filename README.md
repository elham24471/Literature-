#### Papers read in 2021(#papers-read-in-2021)

##### [20-12-21] [paper#1]
- Control Oriented Modeling and Identification of Nonlinear Systems
- [[pdf]](https://www.scientific.net/AMM.841.330)
- *Ali Emami,  Afshin Banazadeh*
- [[System Identification]](#system-identification)
- ```In this paper a low-order equivalent linear model of the nonlinear system is obtained.```
- ```Didn't find it useful for my purpose.```
- ```Practical for identification using frequency domain analysis where small number of points in iteration identification are needed.```

##### [21-12-21] [paper#2]
